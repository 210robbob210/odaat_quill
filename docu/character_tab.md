# What does the character tab do?

With the character tab you can take full control about the prompting style Prompt Quill will create for you.
The content for the prompts still comes from the vector store based on your prompt you enter, but the style and level of detail of the output prompt is based on the query answer results in that character tab.
So play around with this and enter examples of how you would like the prompts to become and you will see the output will get more close to your personal way of prompting.
