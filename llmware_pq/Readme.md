# this is the llmware version of prompt quill

to run this you should check out llmware and put the llmware folders inside of this folder.
They are working hard day and night to get the latest changes in, so it might be that a pip install is not the very latest version.
so the very latest version you can find here https://github.com/llmware-ai/llmware

Or you try and just do a pip install llmware
